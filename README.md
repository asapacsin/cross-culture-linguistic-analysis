Cross-Culture Linguistic Analysis
This repository contains tools, scripts, and datasets for analyzing linguistic differences and similarities across cultures. It focuses on cross-cultural aspects of language use, such as sentiment expression, politeness strategies, metaphor usage, emotion vocabulary, or syntactic patterns in different languages and cultural contexts.
Features

Data collection and preprocessing pipelines for multilingual texts
Statistical analysis and visualization of cross-cultural linguistic features
Machine learning models for detecting cultural influences in language
Comparative studies (e.g., English vs. Chinese, Spanish vs. Arabic, etc.)

Finding
Both Chinese and English exhibit strong pronoun use in school life topic.
