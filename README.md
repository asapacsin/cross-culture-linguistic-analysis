# Cross-Cultural Linguistic Analysis

This repository provides tools, scripts, and datasets for analyzing linguistic differences and similarities across cultures. It focuses on cross-cultural aspects of language use, including:

- Sentiment expression
- Politeness strategies
- Metaphor usage
- Emotion vocabulary
- Syntactic patterns

in various languages and cultural contexts.

## Key Features

- Data collection and preprocessing pipelines for multilingual texts
- Statistical analysis and visualization of cross-cultural linguistic features
- Machine learning models for detecting cultural influences in language
- Comparative studies (e.g., English vs. Chinese, Spanish vs. Arabic, etc.)

### Key Finding
Both Chinese and English show strong pronoun use when discussing school-life topics.
